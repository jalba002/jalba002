- Hi, I’m @jalba002
- I’m interested in modding games, inverse engineering and creating fun gameplay mechanics.
- I’m currently learning a bunch of things, all related to videogames. Currently testing new ways of implementing stuff I left for dead some time ago.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any Dark Souls 3 mod, as it is one of my favorite games to break and to play. Otherwise Unity and C# programming also fills
me with joy.
