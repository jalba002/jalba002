- Hi, I’m @jalba002 or JordiAlbaDev in other platforms.
- I’m interested in modding, inverse engineering, tools and gameplay mechanics.
- I've also implemented Photon and Mirror in Unity as my university thesis.
- I’m currently learning a bunch of things, all related to videogames. Currently testing new ways of implementing stuff I left for dead some time ago.
- I'm looking to contribute on tools now that i'll have more free time, and expand my knowledge creating mechanics and my own tools.
